# todo-list

This project tought me how to create app with vue.js and how to use it with Supabase.

Features of my Todo App:

- Create a new user, sign in and out
- create, edit, delete, complete/uncomplete tasks
- tasks are ordered by completed-state (first it lists all uncompleted tasks and below the completed)
- hover effect on each tasks for the edit and delete button to reduce clutter and make it look "cleaner"
- tasks can be completed by clicking on the corresponding checkbox to the left of the task
- app is responsive and can be used on any device

### Bonus

- added a "delete all completed tasks" button
